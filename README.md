# Obit-ASCII
OBit ASCII is a text based version of the retro-style game, developed for a type-in weekly event. The idea of a "type-in" is to design a small, simple game in just one file. 

Puzzle game, consiting of a orb, 'o' who has to make their way to the 'E', the exit. You must follow the correct path in order to complate each level.
